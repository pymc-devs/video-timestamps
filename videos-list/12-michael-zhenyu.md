Title: A Bayesian Approach to Media Mix Modeling

Video: https://youtu.be/UznM_-_760Y

Event description:
This talk describes how we built a Bayesian Media Mix Model of new customer acquisition using PyMC. We will explain the statistical structure of the model in detail, with special attention to nonlinear functional transformations, discuss some of the technical challenges we tackled when building it in a Bayesian framework, and touch on how we use it in production to guide our marketing strategy.
