Title: Learning Bayesian Statistics with Pokemon GO


Event description:

In the mobile game Pokemon GO, players can rarely encounter "shiny" Pokemon. The exact appearance rates are unknown. But by using Bayesian inference and PyMC3, we can model different speciesâ€™ shiny rates. In this beginner-level tutorial, we will introduce fundamental principles at the heart of Bayesian modeling; then we will apply them to develop PyMC3 models that can answer questions about Pokemon GO.
