Title: The MLDA multilevel sampler in PyMC

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvsGyvAElLY

Event description: 
This presentation will give you the chance to know more about PyMCâ€™s new multilevel MCMC sampler, MLDA, and help you use it in practice. MLDA exploits multilevel model hierarchies to improve sampling efficiency compared to standard methods, especially when working with high-dimensional problems where gradients are not available. We will present a step-by-step guide on how to use MLDA within PyMC3, go through its various features and also present some advanced use cases, e.g. employing multilevel PDE-based models written in FEniCS and using adaptive error correction to correct model bias between different levels.
