Title:  [Keynote] Inferring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 --- and measures to mitigate it

Event description:
With the second waves of COVID-19 unfolding in most European countries, it is worth to look back at the first wave and especially the past summer, where case numbers were case numbers stayed low. I will present approaches to infer the effectiveness of interventions, and models to explore their potential. This talk will be interesting for anyone wanting to understand the current and potential future dynamics of COVID-19.

Speaker bio:
Viola heads a research team at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization. She investigates the self-organization of spreading dynamics in the brain to understand the emergence of living computation. With the outbreak of COVID-19, she adapted these mathematical approaches to infer and predict the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and to investigate mitigation strategies. Viola is board member of the Campus Institute for Data Science and Fellow of the Schiemann Kolleg.
