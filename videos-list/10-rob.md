Title: A Tour of Model Checking Techniques

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfqPGGCpY6I

Event description:
Have you ever written a model in PyMC and aren’t sure if it’s any good? In this talk I will show you the many ways you can evaluate how well your model fits your data using PyMC. Not all these techniques may be applicable for your particular problem, but you will definitely walk away with a few new tricks for being confident in the models you fit.
