Speaker info: 
Osvaldo is a researcher at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina and is notably the author of the book Bayesian Analysis with Python, whose second edition was published in December 2018. He also teaches bioinformatics, data science and Bayesian data analysis, and is a core developer of PyMC and ArviZ, and recently started contributing to Bambi. Originally a biologist and physicist, Osvaldo trained himself to python and Bayesian methods – and what he’s doing with it is pretty amazing!

In the year 2014, Pedro completed his Bs. in Molecular Biology at the National University of San Luis, Argentina and in 2020 he finished his PhD in the Instute of Applied Mathematics (IMASL) while working within the Structural Bioinformatics Group (BIOS). His PhD thesis was centered around the use of a statiscal mechanics model to simulate biologically relevant systems of peptide-lipid interactions. Currently, he is doing his postdoc alongside Dr. Osvaldo Martin on probabilistic modeling and Sequential Monte Carlo.
