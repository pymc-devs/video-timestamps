Title: Including partial differential equations in your PyMC3 model


Event description:

This tutorial will demonstrate use of PyMC3 for PDE-based inverse problems. We will infer parameters of a simple continuum mechanics model but the demonstrated tools can be readily applied to other complex PDE-based models.
