# Video Timestamps

## Why We Are Adding Timestamps

:stopwatch: We are adding timestamps to the PyMC YouTube videos.  When timestamps are available:
1. It makes it easy for viewers to get to the part in the video they are interested in.
2. It also helps potential viewers find the video based on their search terms.

:pray: Your helpful contribution is greatly appreciated!!

## Instructions

1. Watch the video and add descriptive timestamps to the issue you opened.
2. To submit your timestamps, there are two options:
  * Open a new issue with the videos title to "claim" the video such that there's no overlapping work
  * Create a pull request with the timestamps in this folder: [videos-list](https://github.com/pymc-devs/video-timestamps/tree/main/videos-list)
3. Below is a preliminary list. The [video descriptions](https://www.youtube.com/c/PyMC-Developers) can first be checked to see if the timestamps are there or not.
4. When you pick a video to work work, please open an issue, so two people are not working on the same video (avoid duplicating work).
5. Please pick one video at a time.
